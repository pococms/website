# Formatting characters in Markdown 

Here's how to do things like *italic*, bold, and ~~strikethrough~~.

## Bold text in Markdown

To make text bold, surround it with `**` on each side. Avoid spaces.
Note: technically this is called *strong text*, which is
more semantic meaning.

##### Markdown:

```markdown
You never expected a **Spanish Inquisition!**
```

##### Results:

You never expected a **Spanish Inquisition!**

## Italic text in Markdown

To make text italic, surround it with `_` on each side. Avoid spaces.
You can also use `*` on each side.

Note: this is technically called *emphasized text*. 

##### Markdown:

```markdown
Robert left his space suit at the cleaners. _What will NASA say?_
More important, *how can he choose his italics Markdown?*
```

##### Results:

Robert left his space suit at the cleaners. _What will NASA say?_
More important, *how can he choose his italics Markdown?*

## Monospaced text in Markdown

To use a monospaced font, surround it with `` ` `` on each side. Avoid spaces.

##### Markdown:

```
The killer computer displayed a frightening message: `hello, world.`
```

##### Results:

The killer computer displayed a frightening message: `hello, world.`

## Strikethough text in Markdown

To show strikethrough text, surround it with two tildes (`~~`) on each side. Avoid spaces.

##### Markdown:

```markdown
Your children are ~~not very~~ well informed.
```

##### Results:

Your children are ~~not very~~ well informed.
