# Hiding parts of a PocoCMS theme globally

In [The parts of a PocoCMS theme](gs-parts-of-theme.html) you learned how
easy it is to hide the header, footer, and other [page layout elements](glosssary.html#layout-element) on a page. What if you just want them gone completely so you don't have 
to use [SUPPRESS](glossary.html#suppress)? What
if you never need or want these in your theme at all? You make a simple
  change to the theme itself.

## Remove header, nav, aside, or footer from a theme

To remove a header, nav, aside, or footer from a theme so you don't have to 
keep [repeating this process on every page](gs-parts-of-theme.html#hiding-header-nav-aside-or-footer-on-a-per-page-basis), just take it out of the theme altogether.

It's a very simple edit and you don't lose anything. You can easily add it back later.

### Find your theme file in the .poco directory

* If you're reading this tutorial in sequence you're already in the
root directory, but if not it's easy to find, so 
make sure you get to the [root directory](glossary.html#root-directory).
