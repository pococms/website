# Paper theme


Paper is based on the delightful [CSS](https://github.com/papercss/papercss) 
by [Rhyne](https://www.vlaservich.com/).

Paper looks like a fun theme, but you can also use it for
something deadly serious to anyone with a client: showing
how the general layout of a site will look without getting the client
distracted by minutia like the background color of a particular page, or
choice of font on a nav bar.
