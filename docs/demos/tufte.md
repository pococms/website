# Tufte theme

This gorgeous theme is derived from [Tufte CSS](https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/),
and it's very much in the spirity of [Edward Tufte's](https://www.edwardtufte.com) aesthetics.
Mad props to originator [Dave Liepmann](https://www.daveliepmann.com), who later
donated his substantial work to the Tufte ecosystem.

This is an example of a classless theme, to which we
added a minimal layout file to support layout elements:
header, nav, and aside (right only). They tend
to distract so they are suppressed in this demo.

## Supported features
