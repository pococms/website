#### Theme demos

# Base theme

It doesn't look special, but that's the point. [Base](https://github.com/pococms/poco/tree/main/.poco/themes/base) supports the
entire set of theme framework features as shown in the
table below. You get free support for header, nav bar,
aside, footer, and mobile support. All you need to do is
choose fonts, colors, padding, and so on.

It's easy to customize with minimal additions to CSS.
