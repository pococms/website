[Frequently Asked Questions](faq.html)

## Markdown and the Commonmark specification

[Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) was originally created by John Gruber of [Daring Fireball](https://daringfireball.net).  It was a fairly informal specification so a group of Markdown enthusiasts created a more comprehensive spec at [Commonmark.org](https://commonmark.org).
