## Most Valuable Player Award: Yusuke Inuzuka's goldmark packages

The vast majority of the work for Poco CMS was created years
before Poco CMS joined the world: it's the [goldmark parser](https://github.com/yuin/goldmark) and related packages. They were created by the
hugely impressive Yusuke Inuzuka, a [Japanese programmer](http://inforno.net/) 
whose English is better than mine. His username on GitHub is 
[Yuin](https://github.com/yuin). Work like this would be impressive
at any price, but free? Blows me away. And yes, I contributed.

Thanks also to the many other [contributors](https://github.com/yuin/goldmark/graphs/contributors) to [goldmark](https://github.com/yuin/goldmark).

Poco CMS relies on many other inimitable Yuin, including:

* [https://github.com/yuin/goldmark-meta](https://github.com/yuin/goldmark-meta] for handling the YAML [front matter](front-matter.html)
* [https://github.com/yuin/goldmark-highlighting](https://github.com/yuin/goldmark-highlighting) to handley syntax highlighting for code

## Other goldmark-related packages

* [https://github.com/abhinav/goldmark-toc](https://github.com/abhinav/goldmark-toc) for table of contents support
