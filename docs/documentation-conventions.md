# Documentation conventions

This describes how Markdown is standardized for the PocoCMS documentation.

## Screenshots

* Most desktop screenshots are taken at 1366x768
* Use 360x460 for phone vertical shots (it's the most common)
* Considering 1920x1080 for theme previews

### Filenames for code fences

Start as an h5 with `#####`, add `file`, then use strong  
around the actualy filename, like this: 

```
##### file: **footer.md**
```
