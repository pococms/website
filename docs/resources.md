## HTML

Sometimes it's convenient and maybe even a little fun to use colors by name instead of
obscure RGB values or hex codes. Modern browsers recognize 140 
[HTML Color Names](https://htmlcolorcodes.com/color-names/), even though official 
web standards admit to only [16](https://www.w3.org/wiki/CSS3/Color/Basic_color_keywords)
(boo, hiss).

## Classless CSS

Here are some promising classless CSS libraries you can
use in your own themes.

* Liam Dougherty's [Theme switcher](https://dohliam.github.io/dropin-minimal-css/) highlighing many good classless CSS resources. Dr. Dougherty is [disgustingly accomplished and productive](https://dohliam.github.io/)

## Type

* The [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/#charset) font is a new [sans-serif](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-family#sans-serif) font designed
designed for clarity.

## Icons

* [icongram](https://icongr.am) made it so simple to get icons
using their amazing API. They offer thousands of icons,
but you can get them in any size and color by specifying
what you'd like on the command line. For example, this
yields a YouTube logo in SVG format, size 32x32 pixels,
in red (color #`FF0000`).

```

```

* Don't underestimate the 1800+ [Bootstrap icons](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/),


* [Lucide](https://lucide.dev) open source icons

## SVG graphics

* [SVGViewer](https://www.svgviewer.dev) can remove padding from SVGS, validate them, optimize them,
and more.
* [Vecta Nano](https://vecta.io/nano) compresses SVG files with an online interface

## Other graphic assets
