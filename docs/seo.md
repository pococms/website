# SEO

## Concerns

Every once in a while, PocoCMS chooses to break the rules of semantic HTML in minor
ways. These transgressions haven't caused any SEO problems. Examples:

* [2 colors in your logo text](css-tips.html#2-colors-in-your-logo-text) describes how
in the PocoCMS [logo](https://pococms.com) itself abuses the Markdown 
strikethrough characters to change the color of the `CMS` part
of `PocoCMS` in the home page logo. This hasn't seemed to cause
any SEO problems at all, and we have used it in many other sites. 

One reason could be that there is no semantic content in PocoCMS
[theme framework](theme-framework.html) headers. We don't use
`h1` tags (or any other heading level) in headers. Those are
reserved for content inside `<article>` tags as explained elsehere.
