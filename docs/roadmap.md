# Roadmap

Here's what to expect for [PocoCMS](https://pococms.com)
in the near to medium future, from high priority to low.

* Automatic Table of contents creation
* Shortcodes
* Tagging
* Simple search feature using [Elasticlunr.js](http://elasticlunr.com)
* Allow specifying sidebar: right or left in the theme, not just the page
* Allow specifying the burger menu per page, not just per theme,
like headers, footers, etc.
* Collections (for blogs, news sections, etc.)
* Web interface for command-line haters
* Site maps
* PocoCMS author tries to stop caffeine usage. Maybe this needs to move up a few notches
