Hi. I'm Anna Utopia and this is my blog.

I studied design at Montreal's [Concordia University](https://www.concordia.ca/),
where I learned the importance of static site generators, a lesson
that transcends space and time.

I have been doing professional web design for almost 9 years 
and have won multiple national awards. I have two rescue dogs and
can often be found online watching those heartending Dodo videos.
