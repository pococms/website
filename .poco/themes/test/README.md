# TEST theme

Not sure how this is going to work


* Header (optional)
* Nav (optional)
* Aside (optional)
* Support for asides on either left or right
* Footer (optional)
* Mobile support (below certain screen dimensions fonts get bigger
and page layout elements such as aside, nav and footer disappear, 
depending on how limited screen real estate gets)
* Full support even low-end browsers; Javascript is optional

It's easy to customize with minimal additions to CSS.
