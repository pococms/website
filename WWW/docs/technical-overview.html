<h1 id="pococms-technical-overview">PocoCMS Technical Overview</h1>
<p>PocoCMS is a single executable file that reads a
directory tree of files, converts Markdown files
to HTML, and passes the rest through to
the webroot directory unchanged.
The <a href="glossary.html#webroot">webroot</a> is where
HTML, stylesheets, and other file assets
are sent to be published on the Web.</p>
<p>PocoCMS is meant above all to be unobtrusive,
easy to learn, and extremely easy to get
started with. You don't
have to create weird special files get started,
or download a theme from some obscure
location on the web. Just type some Markdown, making
sure the root of your site has a file named <code>index.md</code>
or <code>README.md</code>, and you can get started immediately.</p>
<p>Even if you don't know <a href="glossary.html#markdown">Markdown</a>,
you can just type plain text. Even links get turned into
live hyperlinks without any effort.</p>
<h2 id="looking-good">Looking good</h2>
<p>PocoCMS has theme support, so you can just mention a theme
in the <a href="glossary.html#front-matter">front matter</a> of
the <a href="glossary.html#home-page">home page</a> and
all other pages in the site will inherit that theme.
A theme can also include template files for the
header, nav bar, aside (a.k.a. sidebar), and footer.</p>
<h2 id="running-pococms">Running PocoCMS</h2>
<p>Suppose you plan to create a new site, also known as a project.
You'd create a subdirectory, in this example <code>mysite</code>, and
make it the current directory:</p>
<pre><code># Create a subdirectory named mysite. 
# Replace with your own directory name here.
mkdir ~/mysite
# Make it the current directory.
cd ~/mysite
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Run poco:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>poco
</code></pre>
<p>You're then informed:</p>
<pre><code>Site published to /Users/tom/pococms/poco/ed/WWW/index.html
</code></pre>
<p>Here's what happens when you run <code>poco</code> with no
<a href="cli.html">command-line options</a> as shown previously:</p>
<ul>
<li>PocoCMS looks around to see if the directory is empty (as is
the case in this example, because it was just created).</li>
<li>If that directory was empty, and if it has
no <a href="glossary.html#home-page">home page</a>, PocoCMS
generates a simple <code>index.md</code> file. If you view its contents,
you'll see this:</li>
</ul>
<pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;"><code><span style="display:flex;"><span>---
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>Stylesheets:
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    <span style="color:#00a">-</span> &#34;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/pococms/poco/pages/assets/css/poquito.css&#34;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>---
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#000080;font-weight:bold"># Welcome to mysite
</span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#000080;font-weight:bold"></span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>hello, world.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span></code></pre><p></p>
<p>When you load the web page you'll see it has minimal styling
and that the first part of the file doesn't get displayed.
That first part between the <code>---</code> lines
is called the <a href="front-matter.html">front matter</a>,
and it provides a set of instructions to format and display
the generated HTML, which starts with <strong>Welcome to mysite</strong>.</p>
<p>The front matter is considered a separate document.
It is in <a href="https://yaml.org">YAML</a> format. The only YAML
in this document is <code>Stylesheets:</code>, which is used
to generate a <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tag that pulls in a minimal
spreadsheet from a CDN. It could just as easily
be a local file but this makes for a quick demo.</p>
