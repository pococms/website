# About PocoCMS: Build fast websites, fast


PocoCMS is the fastest way to turn your words and pictures
into a full-featured informational or documentation website. It is a [static site generator](/docs/glossary.html#static-site-generator),
a command-line program specializing in creating 
high-performance, secure sites that don't require database interactivity.

There are a lot of very good [static site generators](https://jamstack.org/generators/).
Only PocoCMS can generate complete SEO-enabled site with
header, navbar, sidebar, and footer with no previous knowledge.

## PocoCMS advantages

* **Near-zero learning curve:** None of the other static site generators
we've used let you do this: Create a simple [Markdown](/docs/glossary.html#markdown)
file, then instantly create a full website from it. They all seem to
need you to know Ruby or Python or NPM. A lot of them require some kind
of odd `_index.md` file or build a theme from scratch before you
can get anything done. All PocoCMS needs is a directory with one or more
Markdown files in it.
* **Free and open source** PocoCMS is free and MIT-licensed. It costs
nothing to try.
* **Extremely high performance** web pages using the PocoCMS [theme framework](/docs/theme-framework.html) have very little overhead. That makes them fast to load, which helps 
SEO and your customers's sanity.
* **Military-grade security:** Because a PocoCMS site is pure HTML and
has no database, it is as safe as a site can be.
* **Keep your themes!** You may not know this, but many web hosting
sites own the look and feel of your site. They won't allow you to 
use their themes if you choose to move to another provider.
* **PocoCMS is single executable file:** Just [download](https://pococms.com/downloads) 
the Poco executable file, put it on your path, and you're good to go. No
installer is required.
* **Built-in SEO:** You don't need plugins or any special knowledge to
supercharge your site's [SEO](/docs/seo.html). PocoCMS has it right out
of the box.
* **Nothing else to install:** Many static site generators won't work without
Ruby or Python installed. PocoCMS is completely self-contained.
* **Old-school simplicity:** PocoCMS doesn't require Javascript frameworks,
elaborate build systems, CSS preprocessors, or package managers. Just
Markdown and, if you want to edit themes, some CSS and HTML.
* **Lightweight pages that work on older web browsers:** PocoCMS was designed 
to make a free press more accessible to everyone, including people with limited
bandwidth or whose phones are a couple generations behind. Most themes made
using the [theme framework](/docs/theme-framework.html) work well without
Javascript and on older browsers.
* **Markdown works on all parts of the page** You can create themes, including headers and footers, using Markdown. 
* **Scriptable:** Because PocoCMS is a command-line utility, you can mass-produce sites
or mass-update pages using shell scripts.

## PocoCMS limitations

**No self-updating** PocoCMS doesn't include a database. That means it
doesn't natively support comments, data entry forms of any kind, or any
other way for users to update information. Only you can change the site.
It is pure HTML; there's no PHP running it like WordPress or Python like
Django or [PY4WEB](https://py4web.com).



**Content editing is manual** For the moment, there's no web interface to 
create, edit, and format articles. You upload a Markdown file, period.

**No admin interface** You make changes to PocoCMS themes simply
by [editing files](/docs/themes-creating.html). So your boss won't
see you twiddling knobs and dials behind an impressive user interface.
