# Todo

## Write
* steal markdown tutorial from vuepress & link to it from tutorial 

## Distribution
* Create formulas for choco, brew tap, apt get, etc.

## Test
* Run `poco -settings` on Windows. Will it show as on the path?
* Do this on a home page. Point is to 

```
stylesheets:
- "foo.css"
- "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/water.css@2/out/water.css"
- "../.poco/css/featuretable.css"
```

## Feature enhancements

* Gossip is unfinished. Current version is the front page of the
site. Do another that's for interior pages. Then make all images
on the front page clickable, and they'd go to a page using
the interior theme.
* ts2 needs a test that shows background of all page layout elemetns, like ts1 has 
* ts2: create a theme
* ts2: Make trashing the factory settings an option:
```
echo "Stress test: Removing factory themes"
rm -rf /Users/tom/Library/Application\ Support/pococms/
```

* Need to get functions working if I want to support toc,
among other things
* Fill out [Paperboard theme demo](docs/demos/paperboard.html), 
source at docs/demos/paperboard.md and docs/demos/paperboard-aside.md

## Themes

* Collect footer CSS, at least from Metabuzz
* Try to get `.poco/css/nav-menu.css` working

## Documentation

* Write [Next Steps](docs/next-steps.html)
* Figure out how to standardize theme documentation
